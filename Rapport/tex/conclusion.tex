\chapter{Conclusion}
A weather visualization application that met the requirements was created successfully.

The implementation of different file types, data visualizing and database integration, to make it easier and to get higher performance, are completed with the help of tools and methods stated in this paper while keeping focus on extensibility, speed and user experience.

Due to lack of time, the support for NetCDF files were not implemented, but the flexibility of the software allows this to be done at a later date without breaking any existing functionality.

The final product ended up being a satisfactorily solution for a weather visualization application that can manage the enormous amounts of data in an intuitive way while being a viable candidate for a future common platform in the industry.
