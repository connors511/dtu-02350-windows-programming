\section{Future work}
\label{sec:future_work}

Because of the limited time for the project, some specifications were left out. Some features that would be useful to have in the application are stated below.

\subsection{Copy and paste classes}

Sometimes it would be convenient to copy and paste created classes. As of now it is not possible to copy class boxes, but it is however possible to copy all the content when editing a class and then paste this text into another class. Thus the outcome will indirectly be the same as copying class boxes.

\subsection{Code scaffold}

When creating a class diagram, it would be neat to generate the represented code automatically in a specified programming language such as C\#, Java or PHP. 

\subsection{Export}

Having an opportunity to export the class diagram to different formats such as XML, PDF or PNG is definitely a good idea so that a diagram can be used on websites, in presentations or imported by other applications.
